To Do:

visual:
- implement button to move between kana and romaji
- make borders on lines

- make a new filter function which can filter on arbitrary lists of kanji passed to it from the filter
- change so that kanji have a greater collid radius to other kanji
- add in-page functionality to toggle view of meaning of kanji
- add in-page functionality to toggle from hiragana and katakana
to romaji
- allow focusing on a specific kanji/reading and seeing x degrees
of separation
- fix zooming/panning
- have added nodes appear at random positions in the screen, not all at 0, 0
- fix the unfocusing on nodes behaviour when you click to pan
