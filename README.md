# kanjikai
Kanjikai presents force directed graph visualisations of kanji and their associated readings.

Kanji have two types of associated readings: kun-yomi (‘Japanese readings’) and on-yomi (‘Chinese readings’).
The same kanji may have zero, one, two, or more of either of these types of readings. In addition, a kanji
will sometimes share one or more of its readings with one or more other kanji.

The force directed graph layout represents this visually, so that the viewer can see the patterns of shared
readings across kanji.

Kanjikai is written in JavaScript using D3.js
